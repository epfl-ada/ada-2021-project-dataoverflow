## Research questions

The main research question we would like to answer is:

**What is the view of the western world on China?**

In order to answer this question, we propose the following sub-questions:

- What main topics do western people associate China with?
    We would like to analyze which topics western public figures present when talking about China. We think that this is a good first-shot method to gain insight into possible answers to the main research question, as they provide our later analyses with context about the relationship between the west and China. A possible finding might for example be that in 2020, the most frequent topic regarding China is Covid-19. This would then provide context to an analysis between for example the view of different political parties.
- How did this association change over time?
- Is it different between the political parties and different press?
- Did Donald Trumpâ€™s view change after becoming president?
