# Quotations: China from a western perspective.
Over the years we have observed deteriorating relations between the US and China. In previous years we have seen escalating tensions as a result of the increasing trade deficit of the US with respect to China. More recently, the news has been dominated by the worldwide outbreak of Covid-19, for which some in the US blame China. It seems that often much of the opinions people hold find their origins with some public figure. Our research would therefore like to analyze the utterances of western public figures about China, as a reflection of the oppinions of the general public. This research will therefore aim to provide an account of the changing relations as viewed from the western perspective. 

## Research questions

The main research question we would like to answer is:

**What is the view of the western world on China?**

In order to answer this question, we propose the following sub-questions:

- What main topics do western people associate China with?

    We would like to analyze which topics western public figures present when talking about China. We think that this is a good first-shot method to gain insight into possible answers to the main research question, as they provide our later analyses with context about the relationship between the west and China. A possible finding might for example be that in 2020, the most frequent topic regarding China is Covid-19. This would then provide context to an analysis between for example the view of different political parties.

- How do these topics vary from time?

   After extracting all the topics western press related China with, we are interested in how the main topics people tends to related China in different year or under different events. We want to answer this question by building a graph showing how the topics about China changes by analysing the main topic in a certain time period, for example in every two weeks. After that, we can have a clearer look about how topics changes and may associate topics with the big events happened during that time.
    
- What are the attitudes of the Western people towards these topic? Have these attitudes ever changed?
   

- Do attitudes differ between countries, the political parties and different news sources?

There are also some questions that worth investigating:

- For some certain speakers, Have their views ever changed?

- Do the views of the same speaker differ when quoted by different press?

- Will there be any difference between the view of Western press and that of ordinary people ?
