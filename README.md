We would like to analyze the view of China in the eyes of western public figures. Over the years we have observed deteriorating relations between the US and China, caused in previous years by, the US China trade war, and more recently the outbreak of Covid-19. With this research we would like to provide an account of the changing relations as viewed from the western perspective. 

## Research questions

The main research question we would like to answer is:

**What is the view of the western world on China?**

In order to answer this question, we propose the following sub-questions:

- What main topics do western people associate China with?

    We would like to analyze which topics western public figures present when talking about China. We think that this is a good first-shot method to gain insight into possible answers to the main research question, as they provide our later analyses with context about the relationship between the west and China. A possible finding might for example be that in 2020, the most frequent topic regarding China is Covid-19. This would then provide context to an analysis between for example the view of different political parties.
- How did this association change over time?


- Is it different between the political parties and different press?
- Did Donald Trumpâ€™s view change after becoming president?
