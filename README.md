## Research questions

The main research question we would like to answer is

**What is the view of the western world on China?**

In order to answer this question, we propose the following sub-questions:

- What main topics do western people associate China with?
- How did this association change over time?
- Is it different between the political parties and different press?
- Did Donald Trumpâ€™s view change after becoming president?
